          An integral part of South Asian diaspora communities, food offers a
          harmonious balance of textures, temperatures and flavours. Like art,
          South Asian cuisine is all things spectacular â€“ subtle complexities,
          overwhelming flavours, homely warmth of the masalas, the aroma of the
          spices &amp; herbs and a kaleidoscope of colours. In a South Asian
          meal, spices play a vital role in the cuisine, health-care and
          spirituality. Spiciness is not always limited to lots of chillies or
          black pepper; it has to do with various aromatic spices that typify
          South Asian cuisines.
